This the report for Part 2 of Lab 5's assignment. 


How the program works for the user :
The program works for the user by having them first open a txt file of their choosing and then performing several tasks on it. 
They can see what sayings are in the text file, add more sayings to it, analze the text file based on the criteria, or save the new 
sayings into a new file with a nameo of their choosing. All of this functions through a repeated menu that also gives the user the
option to quit out of if they choose to do so. 


How the program works internally: 
This program works by first opening a random text file with sayings in it. This could be any text file but for 
simplicity's sake, I just used the startup.txt file that was provided. The program fopens that file and then pulls
all of the lines on the file pointer into a 2D array called sayings. The rest of the program functions by having
a switch case statement for the menu that directs certain smaller functions based on the user need. The functions 
can either print the sayings string with a for loop, add a saying to the array with strcpy, filter out certain strings 
that contain a phrase with strstr, add all of the phrases to a new txt file with fprintf, or filter certain strings based on 
character length in a for loop. The function also has a noticeable ending and default case. For a lot of the functions,
I needed to pass the sayings string for it to change or analyze with the count or number of sayings in the string for a 
for loop to function. 

Verified:
I have verified that the program works by messing around with all of its functions and in different orders. For example, I have 
added the saying "I like tissues" into the program, sorted the sayings by the word academic, printed the sayings and also 
saved it into a new file.
