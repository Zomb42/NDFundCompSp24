This is the report for part 2 of Lab7

From the user's perspective, the USA states program works by first having them run
an executable runstates, enter in a csv file, and then click different options in a menu.
Depending on what the user wants to do, they print the recorded csv file in a variety of formats
to know for example what states were founded after a year or what state's abbreviations 
contain a certain letter. They will keep entering responses into the menu until they press and enter 6 to quit. 

The program works internally by first reading the csv file with the strtok function before having 
several functions print the data in different formats. All of the states's infromation from the csv
are recorded into an array of struct for easier usage and manipulation. There is a menu function that
operates with a switch  case statement but for the rest of the arrays, they function by having a for 
loop operate on the array and print some data that fits some critera for the function. An example of this 
can be having a couple if statements check if the user inputted string is the name or abbreivation of
a state, and if so, print out the capital. 

I have tested all of the functions on the statesinfo.csv file and it seems to have worked. I have also tried
putting edge test cases like 2000 for the year and the program operates as accordingly
