This is the report for Lab 3 and will explain the text menu calculator. The calculator functions by having a while loop in main
that repeats until the user 'quits' from the program and is done using its functions. The calculator has 4 functions 
that consist of the main operations of arithmetic, subtraction, multiplication, and division. All of these functions will perform
the proper computation but then print out the correct statements. In the main function, these sub functions are organized in a switch
case conditional statement to provide greater clarity of what happens for each user response. The user can just enter a response
for whatever operation they want and then the 2 numbers to see the result. If they choose to exit, they can just enter 5 and will
subsequently leave the while loop. I have verified that the output of the program is correct and have messed around with the numbers
to try and detect any bugs. The numbers match up with my calculator.
