This program works by having a display function with a while loop that keeps repeating a menu that prompts the user for
an answer. Based on that answer, the display function calls another function that usually performs a for 
loop that will give an answer to whatever question was asked by the user. These answer functions typically 
search for years that match a certain result or condition and once it finds it, it prints 1900 + index value 
which gives the year. This program includes functions that find minimum number of wins per year, minimum number
of losses per year, the win/loss record for a given year, years above a certain win percentage, and years where they played
above a certain number of games. 
This makes an intuitive experience for the user where they just keep entering numbers
based on what questions they want to ask. If they ever want to quit the program, they can just enter 6 and 
that will exit the switch case system made by the display function. I have verified that the output of the program
is correct based on the example test results and by manualling looking at the data.
